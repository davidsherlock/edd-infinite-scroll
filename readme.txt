Infinite scrolling product lists for Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

**Infinite Scroll** for Easy Digital Downloads loads the content of your product list in a sequential way: think about Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram – these three navigation systems now influence how we browse the web. EDD Infinite Scroll incorporates this idea for an immediate and direct consultation of the products of your Easy Digital Downloads site!

No more loading times caused by the change of a page; everything comes as a single solution where users – even from mobile devices – can simply scroll down and get the product details they seek right away, without being afraid of losing them when loading a new page.

* Option to enable infinite scroll by default on all [downloads] and [edd_downloads] shortcodes on your site.
